    <h1>Soumak Maitra</h1>
    <p>
      Hello and welcome! I’m a postdoctoral researcher in cosmology and astrophysics at the Department of Theoretical Physics, "Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai". I did my Ph.D. at the "Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune", and spent time in Italy as a postdoc at "Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica – Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste (INAF–OATs), Italy". I’m broadly interested in the large-scale structure of the Universe and its early evolution, including the Epoch of Reionization.
