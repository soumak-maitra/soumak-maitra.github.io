Welcome! I’m **Soumak Maitra**, a postdoctoral researcher in cosmology and astrophysics at the Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai.

I am interested in cosmic reionization and its spatial morphology, which I study by modeling Lyman-α emitters as tracers of the process. More broadly, my research explores the large-scale structure of the Universe and the physical state of the intergalactic medium through quasar absorption spectra. I am also actively exploring the use of machine learning techniques to uncover physical insights from both cosmological simulations and observational datasets.
