Welcome! I’m **Soumak Maitra**, a postdoctoral researcher in cosmology and astrophysics at the Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai.

My research focuses on the formation and evolution of large-scale structure, cosmic reionization, and the intergalactic medium. I also apply machine learning techniques to extract physical insights from simulations and observational data. I have experience working with both hydrodynamical simulations (e.g., GADGET) and quasar absorption spectra, particularly the Lyman-α forest.

Feel free to explore my [research](/research/), [publications](/publications/), [talks](/talks/), or [get in touch](/contact/).
