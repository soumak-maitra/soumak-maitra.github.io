    <h1>Soumak Maitra</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome! I’m Soumak Maitra, a postdoctoral researcher in cosmology and astrophysics at the
      Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai.
      I’m broadly interested in the large-scale structure of the Universe and its early evolution,
      including the Epoch of Reionization. I use simulations, observations, and machine learning
      to study how cosmic structures form and evolve over time.
