## Research Interests

- Large-scale structure formation and cosmic reionization
- Astrophysics of the intergalactic medium (IGM)
- Lyman-α forest and Lyman-α emitters as cosmological probes
- Quasar absorption lines and high-redshift spectroscopy
- Machine learning in astrophysical and cosmological analysis
- N-body and hydrodynamical simulations
- Observational cosmology with high-redshift tracers

## Current Work

At TIFR, I’m focused on integrating deep learning methods—particularly variational autoencoders and information maximizing neural networks—with simulated and observed quasar absorption data, to probe the morphology of reionization and constrain cosmological parameters.

My recent work includes:
- Modeling the LAE bispectrum to characterize patchiness during reionization.
- Using higher-order clustering statistics in redshift space for the Lyman-α forest.
- Developing neural network pipelines for parameter inference directly from Fourier-space features.
