My research lies at the intersection of cosmology and astrophysics, with a focus on the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution across cosmic time. I am particularly interested in understanding the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the Epoch of Reionization, using both theoretical modeling and modern data-driven methods.

I work with high-redshift probes such as the Lyman-α forest and Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) to study the distribution of matter, the growth of structure, and the physics of reionization. A key theme of my work is the development of new statistical and machine-learning–based techniques for extracting cosmological and astrophysical information from these observables.

Ultimately, my goal is to advance our understanding of how cosmic structures formed and evolved, and to bridge the gap between theory, simulations, and observations of the high-redshift Universe.
