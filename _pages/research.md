## Research

My research lies at the intersection of theoretical astrophysics, cosmology, and data-driven analysis. I am broadly interested in the formation and evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe, the astrophysics of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and the physical processes governing cosmic reionization.

A significant part of my work involves studying the IGM using quasar absorption spectra, particularly the Lyman-α forest. By analyzing its clustering properties and redshift evolution—both in observations and simulations—I aim to understand the distribution of neutral hydrogen and the growth of structure in the early Universe.

In parallel, I work on Lyman-α emitters (LAEs) as cosmological tracers, especially during the Epoch of Reionization. I develop tools to model their spatial clustering and use higher-order statistics such as the bispectrum to constrain the topology and morphology of ionized regions. These efforts are directly relevant to current and upcoming surveys.

More recently, I have been integrating machine learning techniques—especially deep learning models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and information-maximizing neural networks (IMNNs)—into my cosmological workflows. These tools enable tomographic reconstruction of 3D density fields, parameter estimation from high-dimensional data, and novel ways of exploring simulated and observational datasets.

I also have experience with hydrodynamical and N-body simulations (e.g., GADGET), and I often work with mock survey realizations to test methods that bridge theory and observation.
